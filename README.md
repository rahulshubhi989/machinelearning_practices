## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the well-known Boston Housing Dataset. The notebook covers various steps, including:

  * Data loading from a CSV file
  * Initial data exploration using `df.head()` and `df.tail()`
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * (Optional: Add if your notebook includes this) Feature engineering
  * (Optional: Add if your notebook includes this) Implementation of a machine learning model for prediction
  * (Optional: Add if your notebook includes this) Model evaluation and visualization of results

## Dataset

The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset often used for regression tasks. It contains information about houses in various suburbs of Boston, including:

  * **CRIM**: per capita crime rate by town
  * **ZN**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
  * **INDUS**: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
  * **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
  * **NOX**: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
  * **RM**: average number of rooms per dwelling
  * **AGE**: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
  * **DIS**: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
  * **RAD**: index of accessibility to radial highways
  * **TAX**: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
  * **PTRATIO**: pupil-teacher ratio by town
  * **B**: $1000(Bk - 0.63)^2$ where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town
  * **LSTAT**: % lower status of the population
  * **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (the target variable)

The dataset is loaded directly from a URL within the notebook.

## Contents

  * `Bouston_dataset_practice.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data loading and EDA.
  * `(Optional) data/`: (If you downloaded the dataset separately) Directory for the raw dataset.
  * `(Optional) plots/`: (If you saved plots) Directory to store generated visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+). The notebook uses libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```

    (Replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1.  **Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # OR
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Your web browser will open to the Jupyter interface.
3.  Navigate to and open `Bouston_dataset_practice.ipynb`.

## Usage

Once the notebook is open, you can run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, or add your own insights.

## Results

(This section is optional but highly recommended. Briefly summarize key findings or show an example plot. If your notebook includes model performance, mention it here.)

  * Initial insights from EDA.
  * Key features identified that impact housing prices.
  * (If applicable) Performance metrics of the predictive model (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
